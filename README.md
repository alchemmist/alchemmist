### Somthing else
- My **[CV](https://github.com/alchemmist/CV/blob/main/pdf/english.pdf)** is public and open-source, build with latex. Read it, ask questions, use as template!
- I'm **Linux** user _(currently Arch)_, so i have a [dotfiles](https://github.com/alchemmist/.dotfiles). There you will find useful scripts, productivity shell setup, etc.
- My main text editor is a **Neovim**. I’m writing my configuration from scratch, so it’s very minimalistic and custom. [Try it](https://github.com) and fork!
- Furthermore I’m write a **colorscheme** [nothing](https://github.com/alchemmist/nothing.nvim) for Neovim with minimum of color: code – is not a garland.
